# NetBots - multiplayer robot programming game.

## NetBots Universe
### Summary
Browser based programming game where players can code behavior of bots in a persistent online world. Bots can gather resources, build structures and conquer territory by building outposts. Programming can be done through game code editor by writing JavaScript or through graph editor by placing and connection specific nodes (TODO: Look into NodeRED).

### Functional requirements
1. Bots should be able to:
    * Mine resources present in the world.
    * Communicate with each other by passing messages at a certain range.
    * Clone themselves when specific conditions are met (spends energy).
    * Can haul other bots without energy to recharging station.
    * Build these structures:
        * Power plant - converts mined resources into energy.
        * Batteries - holds energy generated by the power plant (bots could regularly recharge?)
        * Paths - for faster movement.
        * Outposts - has a specific range to show the claim to the territory.
        * Automatic mines - to mine resources.
        * "Underground" wires - to deliver power to structures which require energy.
        * Walls and gates - for protection and structural clarity.
        * Laser gun turrets - to defend agains other player bots.
        * Resource storage - to hold gathered resources (should support filters).
        * Manufacturing plant - to build modules for bots (TODO: Could be expanded.)
2. Player should be able to draw blueprints of the area - place structures which should be build by bots.

### Non functional requirements
1. Writing scripts for bots should be available by writing JavaScript and through node based graph editor in the browser.
2. Server should send updates regularly to the client twice per second (2 ticks per second) (will likely change in the future).
    * Client does not need to make predictions about game state. Server send an update and client playes animation, for example, for moving from one tile to another. Then, waits for the next update.
3. Game map does not have boundaries - bots can wander in eny direction endlessly.
4. Bots who run out of energy cannot move or perform any tasks.
5. Each tile of the map shoud have temperature (bots may not be able to function properly with default modules or efficiently if temperature is too low / high).
6. "Fog of war" shoud be present. Each bot can reveal portions of the map with its field of view (which can be extended through external modules).  
7. Bots should be able to attach modules to improve resistances in extreme temperatures, increase movement, building or mining speed, increase view range (circular).

### Entities
This sections describes entities of the game. Keep in mind that this is not a representation of the game classes or database tables.

| Bot                    |                                                                                                                                   |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Position  : vector     | Position in the game world (2D tile coordinates)                                                                                  |
| Rotation  : float      | Rotation in radians                                                                                                               |
| Scale     : vector     | Scale in the game world which is fixed to the number of tiles in width and height (e.g. 1x1, 2x1, 5x5)                            |
| Health    : float      | Basically, it is a metric of robot's structural integrity. It is decreased when robot takes damage from guns or other hazards.    |
| Energy    : float      | Energy is spent when job is performed (each unit of work consumes energy).                                                        |
| Modules   : array      | List of attached modules extending or improving bot's functionality                                                               |

| Resource          |
---------------------
| Type     : string | Type of resource. Could be material for power plant, stone, some kind metal for buildings of production.                                  |  
| Hardness : float  | Each performed unit of work (mining in this case) subtracts capacity from the tile. Hardness determines how much is subtracted in inverse | 
| Capacity : flloat | How much resources are left in this tile.

| Module            |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Effect type       | Type of provided effect (e.g. movement, work speed, field of view range) |
| Effect strength   | How influential is this effect to the default value.                     |
